# Spark Streaming for dynamic schema

In this Spark Streaming Project we have  JSON's of various formats coming from the same Kafka topic and using GSON library we try to figure out the right type of JSON's and then group them and into seperate dataframes. Once we have seperate Dataframes where we have JSON's with the same underlying schema type we should be able to run sql like queries.
